This package aims at handling [pointer events][pointer-events] in elm.
Pointer events are a unified interface for similar input devices
(mouse, pen, touch, ...).

Since maintaining both mouse and touch events for compatibility
is really cumbersome, using a unified pointer events interface
is a relief.
However this API [is not well supported by all browsers][caniuse-pointer].
So I strongly recommend to use it in pair with a [polyfill][poly-pointer]
for compatibility with all major browsers.
